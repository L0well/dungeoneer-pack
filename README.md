# dungeoneer-pack
A try-harding TacO pack for dungeons.

## Installation
### Manual zipping (simple)
You can add custom TacO packs (.zip archives) to your POIs folder. Just zip the `.xml` files and `Data` directory using your favorite archive manager and place the .zip in your TacO POIs folder.

### tacofy (advanced)
You can use `tacofy.ps1` to automatically zip the pack for you. This requires 7zip and the ability to run PowerShell scripts, you will also need to edit `tacofy.ps1` to specify the right source and target locations. This is recommended if you want to make edits to the pack and quickly build the .zip archive to the right location.

### Manual file placement (not recommended)
If you don't want to zip this repository, you should be able to place all the `.xml` files and `Data` directory into your TacO POIs folder as is. This is not recommended.

## Usage
In-game, enable the Dungeoneer Pack in TacO. Common markers like sigils and potions, blink locations, and day/night indicators can be toggled under 'Common Markers'. Path-specific markers (e.g. Ascalonian Catacombs path 1 scepter piece locations) can be toggled at the dungeon and path level.
