# dungeoneer-pack
A try-harding TacO pack for dungeons.

## Installation

### Releases
Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/nomadicTree/dungeoneer-pack/releases/latest) to download the latest release. Simply move the .zip file to your TacO POIs folder.

### From source
#### Manual zipping (simple)
Just zip the `.xml` files and `Data` directory using your favorite archive manager and place the .zip in your TacO POIs folder.

#### tacofy (advanced)
You can use `tacofy.ps1` to automatically zip the pack for you. This requires 7zip and the ability to run PowerShell scripts, you will also need to edit `tacofy.ps1` to specify the right source and target locations. This is recommended if you want to make edits to the pack and quickly build the .zip archive to the right location.

## Usage
In-game, enable the Dungeoneer Pack in TacO. Common markers like sigils and potions, blink locations, and day/night indicators can be toggled under 'Common Markers'. Path-specific markers (e.g. Ascalonian Catacombs path 1 scepter piece locations) can be toggled at the dungeon and path level.
